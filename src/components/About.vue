          <p>Having spent three years at Toronto tech darling FreshBooks, during a period of immense growth and change, working on the Webby-nominated website as a Front-End Developer, it was my job to not only build a world-class website but also help curate a simple and positive experience for the end-user.</p>
          <br>
          <p>
            My interest in the userâ€™s experience led me to a UX path, where I use
            <strong>research</strong>,
            <strong>storytelling</strong>,
            <strong>empathy</strong>,
            <strong>strategy</strong> and
            <strong>technology</strong> in creating both an incredible and lasting experience for the user.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>I am currently based in London, England where I work at the Government Digital Service as an interaction designer.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Aside from my interest in UX and Technology, I am a total pop-culture nerd who makes a great effort to attend concerts and the cinema. I love to travel and visit art galleries, museums, and craft breweries.</p>
